        <h2>Overloaded with adorable canals and bridges, Amsterdam brings the charm</h2>
    
        <p>
            From its picturesque canals and bridges to its historic homes, Amsterdam is a full-blown fairytale. The brightly-coloured bicycles and tulip stands around town donâ€™t hurt either. Must-see sights include the Anne Frank House, the Van Gogh Museum, and the world's only floating flower market. Rent a bike and join thousands of locals peddling around. Other visitors might want to linger in the local coffee shops, which is just a normal part of the city's landscape.
